## Project 1 (Lidar Obstacle Detection)

- Created a pipiline for `segmentation` and `clustering` of the real time `PCD` data.
- Real time `PCD` data is streamed to the pipeline.
- Data is downsampled using `Voxel-Grid`.
- Implemented `Ransac Algorithm` for segmentation of road from obstacles.
- Implemented `Euclidean Clustering Algorithm` using `KD-Tree` for clusteration of the obstacles.

### This is how the results looks like:
